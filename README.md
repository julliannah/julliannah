It's great to see you here.
- ðŸ‘‹ My name is NhÃ n Nguyá»…n but you can call me @Julliannah.
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently learning for Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) in RMIT University Vietnam.
- ðŸ‘€ My hobbies are about food&drink, travelling and landscape photography.

This Git is a little world to publish every piece of works that I've done through my uni life.
Enjoy!
